555c7f8aeded393b19cfa734: Well right now Im working on one of the most common of materials: steel.
555c7f8aeded393b19cfa734: But they are so super complicated and there already has been loads of work on it.
5663f08dad0cd23e090a5d2d: Huh. Interesting. You should tell me more about it over drinks.
555c7f8aeded393b19cfa734: Any time. Though not without a like exchange. Of what would you tell me?

555c7f8aeded393b19cfa734: My first language is English. Whats your second language.
555c7f8aeded393b19cfa734: Stories need to be told. They provide structure and meaning to our lives.

555c7f8aeded393b19cfa734: The stars and traveling
555c7f8aeded393b19cfa734: Animals but living as they should, not cooped up as pets.
5663f08dad0cd23e090a5d2d: Agreed. 
555c7f8aeded393b19cfa734: Whats your motivation for using tinder?
5663f08dad0cd23e090a5d2d: Meet new people. Have sex. Fall in love. Whatever happens, happens.
555c7f8aeded393b19cfa734: Solid reasons.
555c7f8aeded393b19cfa734: Ive met a few good people. Sex has been low on the agenda with many of them, and love not at all.
555c7f8aeded393b19cfa734: I tend to have things develop organically. 
5663f08dad0cd23e090a5d2d: Yeah I like that. I prefer it natural 
5663f08dad0cd23e090a5d2d: So where would you like to go from here 
555c7f8aeded393b19cfa734: My number is 0407 706974. Im rather busy Im afraid at the moment.
555c7f8aeded393b19cfa734: Climbing with friends until 7 this evening. Then dodgeball until 8.30. Then Im nerding it up with friends late this evening to see star wars.
555c7f8aeded393b19cfa734: But if you would like, we can figure out... Somehow... To meet. All tinder chat is largely in vain until you meet eye to eye
5663f08dad0cd23e090a5d2d: Im so jealous. Star wars is awesome 
555c7f8aeded393b19cfa734: Do you see yourself as Ashley on this app?
5663f08dad0cd23e090a5d2d: No 
5663f08dad0cd23e090a5d2d: This is fucking golden 
555c7f8aeded393b19cfa734: Do you think Ashley actually existsÂ¿
555c7f8aeded393b19cfa734: Or is she like santa Claus?
