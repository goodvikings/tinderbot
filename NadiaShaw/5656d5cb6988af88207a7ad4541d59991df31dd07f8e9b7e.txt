5656d5cb6988af88207a7ad4: Hi Nadia ðŸ˜€ Did you know squid brains are doughnut shaped, and their esophagus runs though it? If a squid eats something too big it can get brain damage.
541d59991df31dd07f8e9b7e: I did not know that! I guess you learn something new everyday..

Acctually if you did respond after i said i lived in gymea i didnt get it, tinders kinda buggy sometimes 
541d59991df31dd07f8e9b7e: Haha yea after you said you lived in gymea I said "Ah fantastic! We shall start with taking over the shire first :) haha" lol and yea tinder is buggy,theyre already trying to stop us from taking over!
5656d5cb6988af88207a7ad4: Theyre onto us Nadia! We will have to be more carefull. 
We could move this to texting, then we only have to beware of government spying and given how competent our government is i think we should be safe. 
541d59991df31dd07f8e9b7e: Haha very true! We should! I like how you refer to yourself in the 3rd person to confuse and distract them lol
