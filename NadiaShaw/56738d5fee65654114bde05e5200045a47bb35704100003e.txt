56738d5fee65654114bde05e: Hahahaha well no go ahead let your hair down and be free
56738d5fee65654114bde05e: Hahahaha umm
5200045a47bb35704100003e: I was thinking about celebrating Christmas in drag hahaha.
5200045a47bb35704100003e: Also, very well played in your previous comment. A brilliant double entendre ðŸ˜Š
5200045a47bb35704100003e: To be serious Im on here to find someone that I can relate to. Im not looking for a one night stand, I want someone who gets me. Im slightly quirky but am looking for that other person who can relate and have fun together. 
56738d5fee65654114bde05e: Oh really why drag? Why thankyou I do have a way with words.
5200045a47bb35704100003e: Probably because Im a bit of a mixed bag, In July 2013, I graduated as a mature age student from a double degree in art theory and history, the other as a Journalist. Im also a self taught artist in my spare time, selling a few works through a couple of local art galleries. I have also been a bricklayer for 15 years, running my own business for the last five. At the moment Im trying to make the transition from a full time bricklayer, to working in an art gallery full time as a curator. So im also currently studying a Masters in Curating at Sydney Uni. Haha, so I have a diverse understanding of the world and a diverse personality. 
56738d5fee65654114bde05e: I respect the honesty. One night stands arent ideal, Im looking for more of a friendship someone to get along with.
56738d5fee65654114bde05e: Bricklaying? Interesting. What type of bricks do you lay?
5200045a47bb35704100003e: Haha, another well played word line ðŸ˜Š
5200045a47bb35704100003e: No, Im not a big fan of laying bricks.
5200045a47bb35704100003e: Hates ze bricks. ðŸ˜œ
5200045a47bb35704100003e: But my father once owned a rather large bricklaying company and said after year 12, boy............. If you have not worked out what you want to do in a week. You shall come brick the the world with me. So I turned into a brick for a few years.
5200045a47bb35704100003e: So whats your tale miss?
56738d5fee65654114bde05e: HAHAHAHAHAHA your a classic!
