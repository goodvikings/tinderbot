562a163dff18dab83193e992: Its a good conversation starter also Im really hungry for Mexican right about now :P
Cool Spyros what country does that name come from?
534fd3d66bbdd2f773003279: Yeah I would say it is, :) my name comes from Greece. But I was born and raised in Australia. Where are you from?
562a163dff18dab83193e992: Thats cool :) Im born and raised Australian but my pop was from England so Im technically half English.  But yeah besides that what do you do for a living?
534fd3d66bbdd2f773003279: Ah mad, :) I do real estate :) how about you?
562a163dff18dab83193e992: Im in IT specialising in IT support.  Hey that make me think with property value skyrocketing in Sydney is that good or bad for your job?
534fd3d66bbdd2f773003279: Its somewhere in the middle, now that prices have gone up. Not that many people, want to buy now and yeah ah mad do you enjoy doing it?
562a163dff18dab83193e992: True true thats pretty interesting to know. I thought it would have been really bad unless you get extremely rich clients.  Yeah I love it! I specialise in cloud and Microsoft environment support so both enterprise servers and desktops :) and you do you like realestate?
534fd3d66bbdd2f773003279: Ah mad, sounds like a lot of work. But if you enjoy it thats the main thing. Yeah I enjoy real estate, had its ups and downs but in the end I quite like it. So what part of Sydney do you live?
562a163dff18dab83193e992: Yeah it can be but its like your job has its ups and downs :) Im in Illawong what about you?
534fd3d66bbdd2f773003279: Ah mad, not too far from me actually I live in Sylvania Waters :)
534fd3d66bbdd2f773003279: So what are you doing now?
