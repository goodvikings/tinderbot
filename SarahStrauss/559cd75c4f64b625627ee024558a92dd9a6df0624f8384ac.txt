559cd75c4f64b625627ee024: Whats your favourite pizza topping?
558a92dd9a6df0624f8384ac: Straight to the hard hitting questions, eh?
558a92dd9a6df0624f8384ac: Sprinkled iguana tears, grated notebooks and slices of Mao Zedongs shadow.
559cd75c4f64b625627ee024: Its quite important. Yeah i tried that one once but i wasnt the biggest fan tbh
558a92dd9a6df0624f8384ac: In all seriousness though, I dont have a favourite anything. Food is just a distraction from life. Probably an unpopular answer.
559cd75c4f64b625627ee024: Hmm thats different but not necessarily a bad thing. I can understand that pov i think a bit
558a92dd9a6df0624f8384ac: Most people are in shock when I tell them that. "How can you live without food!?" I say "Technically, I cant. I just dont listen to my tongue." I eat for sustenance. The main senses I aim to please are my sight and hearing.
559cd75c4f64b625627ee024: I agree with that on a some level. So how do you go about that? Movies music etc? Something else
558a92dd9a6df0624f8384ac: Music, psychedelics, hiking/anything natural and philosophy. 
559cd75c4f64b625627ee024: Oh cool, you sound like an interesting peraon sarah
558a92dd9a6df0624f8384ac: Yeah. That. Sorry, Im often in my own world, dreaming of living as far away from the so-called "civilisation".
559cd75c4f64b625627ee024: Hahaha so if you didnt live here where would you live?
558a92dd9a6df0624f8384ac: A place where Id most certainly be killed. The Amazon.
558a92dd9a6df0624f8384ac: Ive experienced death. I do not fear death. I fear not to live fully.
559cd75c4f64b625627ee024: The amazon hey.      Well i dont even really know what to say to that
558a92dd9a6df0624f8384ac: Yeah, I dont expect anyone to say anything. Ill be gone and forgotten, and thats what I want.
559cd75c4f64b625627ee024: Hmmm alright then. My next question 
559cd75c4f64b625627ee024: First thing youd do if you became prime minster tomorrow
558a92dd9a6df0624f8384ac: A toughie. Prime Ministers and Presidents have very little power. The world needs a drastic change. No corporation or government can make that happen. Only the people can change that. So my answer is Id resign.
559cd75c4f64b625627ee024: Hmm you could still have some power a chance to do something meaningful.  
559cd75c4f64b625627ee024: Ok so i change my question so you become emperor of Australia with supreme power to do whatever yoi want
558a92dd9a6df0624f8384ac: Im an anti imperialist. Monarchies are fundamentally flawed. I dont believe one person should change the world. The world needs to change the world. What if I make a really bad judgement call? My philosophies align with people in theory, but people dont want to put the effort into execution. Forcing something never works.
