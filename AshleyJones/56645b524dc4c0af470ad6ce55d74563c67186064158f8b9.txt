Oh Im reading like three things 
A little life by hanya yanagihara
I am sorry to think I have raised a timid son by Kent Russell 
And a graphic novel black hole by Charles burns
55d74563c67186064158f8b9: Same. I thought Id try and be the man and hit out a double session! 😫😫😫😫😫 lol
Wow. Thats some serious skill to read 3 books at once. 🤔
Thursday..... Soooo that means no work on Friday? 😂😂😂
56645b524dc4c0af470ad6ce: I legit cannot see your emojis. 
Nah Im not going hard at the gym at all, used to do bootcamp and stuff heaps but slackened off after three months in New York earlier in the year and am only now doing something about it. Im getting old dude hahaha
Really not skill at all just read half an hour each - Im making an effort feel like I havent been reading much lately. 
I dont work Fridays anyway negotiated myself s four day week haha
So if you had a bio on tinder what would it say?
55d74563c67186064158f8b9: Oh snap, they just laughing faces and pain faces. My bad.
3 months in NYC! Step back! ✊🏽 sounds like you had fun then I guess. 
Pfft! Getting old? Dont let the what the world considers old make you feel inadequate or doubtful about yourself. 🙌🏽 do your thing! 
Same reading is good. I like sport ones a bit more though. Autobiographies and that stuff. 
Sweet! 4 day week! Lucky!!! I dont wanna be that guy baaaaaaaahhhht what do you do for a living??
55d74563c67186064158f8b9: If I had a bio.....
56645b524dc4c0af470ad6ce: Hahaha look truth be told I dont mind my age I just wish I could play sport again like I was a youngn
Oh dude Im a pleb, I project manage this finance thing for a disability ngo, but my passion is film, I have a business degree that lets me pay the bills but Im writing heaps lately and looking to make a feature film eventually, a mans gotta dream. Hence the part time-ness of my work it lets me write. But Im thinking of scaling that back as well so ican write more.
Hahah weird right?

Hows about you?
56645b524dc4c0af470ad6ce: Yeah bio
56645b524dc4c0af470ad6ce: I think Im getting your msgs late

55d74563c67186064158f8b9: If thats your passion, thats your passion. 🤘🏼good thing about that is that you can do it from anywhere! 👌🏽
Me its music. I love all kinds. I love playing music for friends and family. Once I get a few into me, Ill sing and play guitar till its time to pull up stumps. Lol. 
Currently work for the government in the prison system as an officer. Looking for a change now. Travel has taken my heart away. Looking to start doing some labour work with my school friends in the new year to save some money and move around Australia and see this beautiful country I love so much. Im getting over the plane rides and overseas trips. Time to take a look in my own backyard I think while I still can.
55d74563c67186064158f8b9: Sport has always been a love. Combat sport, any sport really. Docos are my thing. Conspiracy theories and theology interest me.
56645b524dc4c0af470ad6ce: Woah thats super interesting, sounds like youve seen tonnes of the world, whats your favourite place? 
And double woah! thats an intense gig youve got there, is it draining? Do you come home exhausted?, a colleague of mine used to work in juvies and he said it was super rewarding, hes an amazing dude.
Nice I like the determination, props to you!
56645b524dc4c0af470ad6ce: Yeah same I dig group sport heaps, I used to box and played tonnes of cricket, wish I had carried it through but its tougher now. What kinda combat sport are you into? Yeah docos are great Ive got a couple on my hard drive Ive been meaning to see, the Wolfpack, Amy, and going clear (the Scientology one) , I made a shirt doco a while back, its about my family, you should check it out! I won an award here and there for it, its so old though made it in 2010. 
Yooooo like all theology? Religion straight up fascinates me too, I grew up super conservative Hindu but my folks were thankfully always very secular and open minded, made me develop tonnes of interest in theology and religion. Hahaha at one stage in my early twenties i considered monk hood no joke! 
Have you heard of Reza Aslan? Hes a professor of theology who writes great books
56645b524dc4c0af470ad6ce: My bad I didnt speak on your love for music, whats your jam? Im a hiphop nerd haha
55d74563c67186064158f8b9: Tones of the world? No way!! Never been to Europe. But I always felt like that was an oldies touristy historic kinda thing. Thailand Phuket has been my favorite by far. 
Draining? Mentally more than anything Id say. Its just as demanding as any other career that involves dealing with people.  Differences in personalities and cultural barriers always brings an element of conflict but I guess its how you manage it. I use a more reserved, distant, professional approach when interacting with staff and inmates. Leave work at work kind of a thing. Thats only been for the past year or so. I was a lot more social at work but I had a good wake up call and realized work is work. Personal and professional should not cross. 
Wow. Hindu. Nice. Christian for me, but Ive a deep love for religion as a whole. I could talk on it for days.
Music? Everything and anything. Hip hop would be the favorite though. 
Yep I have heard of reza aslan it havent read anything from him.
55d74563c67186064158f8b9: Yes! Secular is very connected to spiritual. Albert Einstein said that the more he discovered things, the more he was convinced there is a God or a deity, higher power call it what you will... Lol
55d74563c67186064158f8b9: So whats your doco called?
55d74563c67186064158f8b9: I want to watch it!
56645b524dc4c0af470ad6ce: Yeah I never cared much for Europe either, Ive always found the ancient fascinating and have always gravitated towards the developing world, backpacked through India and South Africa it was cool, NYC is my fav place though, Brooklyn feels like home, oh but you gotta see capetown at some point in your life. 

So interesting yo, i wonder how being a guard changes your perspective on life, like do you savor the little freedoms we take for granted? 

Yeah I feel
Similarly about religion, I think surrender and just the goodness that comes from it is a beautiful thing, its a controversial thing to say but Ive always found Islam especially Sufi mysticism fascinating, I guess that goes hang in hand with being of south Asian heritage though, I love that I grew up Hindu, like its so pluralistic but theres slot of it that I can discard, a lot of it man made prejudice, but all religions have that I feel. But yes spirituality is where its at, again in rambling but I was lucky enough to be inculcated with that from a young age. Reza writes amazing stuff I saw him give a talk a few years ago at sydbey writers festival and it blew my mind.
56645b524dc4c0af470ad6ce: Yooooo what kinda hiphop you like? Imma big Wu tang, biggie and Kanye fan
56645b524dc4c0af470ad6ce: Haha the doco you for real? You wanna see it? IT IS online so I could just paste the link in
56645b524dc4c0af470ad6ce: Its amateurish though :(

55d74563c67186064158f8b9: South east Asia. Where abouts are your parents from?
56645b524dc4c0af470ad6ce: Theyre from Pakistan, straight up messed up country
56645b524dc4c0af470ad6ce: Aight you legit gonna watch this doco if I send you the link?
56645b524dc4c0af470ad6ce: Ugh its so cheesy I cant watch it no more
55d74563c67186064158f8b9: You dont look Pakistani. Lol!
