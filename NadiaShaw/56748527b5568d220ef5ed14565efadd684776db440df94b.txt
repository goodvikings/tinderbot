56748527b5568d220ef5ed14: So have you found out when youve found out yet?
565efadd684776db440df94b: Hey matchy. Hows things? :)
565efadd684776db440df94b: Lol wut? Found out what exactly?
56748527b5568d220ef5ed14: : D ha, Im pretty good how about you? What youre here for?
565efadd684776db440df94b: Im good thanks. Im here for finding a relationship really, but will settle for less
565efadd684776db440df94b: How about you?
565efadd684776db440df94b: Dont leave me in suspense 
56748527b5568d220ef5ed14: Youll settle for less haha, what does that mean? Im sorry I totally left you hanging! To be honest I dont really have an objective but Im not looking for a relationship. First step would be to have a half decent conversation with somebody, so far youre doing pretty well â˜º
565efadd684776db440df94b: Thats alright. Less would be anywhere from chatting, friends, to something short term. This is the longest running conversation Ive had on here so far! Consider me impressed ðŸ˜… so for now Im more than happy to chat
56748527b5568d220ef5ed14: Fair enough, yeah me too normally its like trying to talk to a brick wall. Youre already impressed that has to be good Ive hardly said anything yet. I think Im missing something every time somebody try to send me emojis all I get is little squares, so whatever that was I cant see it : (
565efadd684776db440df94b: It was a laughy face. I have same problem, maybe you have iPhone and theyre not compatible? Ill stick to brackets and semicolons from now on ;) So what do you do wi th yourself? Youve probably worked out what I do already
56748527b5568d220ef5ed14: Haha okay, nar Im not sure Ive got a Samsung. Im not going to give that up that easily youll have to at least take a few guesses first : ) Actually I have no idea, have I missed a clue?
565efadd684776db440df94b: Well its on my profile... :P ok guesses... maybe something in travel or marketing? I have a Samsung too, must just be tinder being lame.
56748527b5568d220ef5ed14: Hmm, either its not showing up for me or the only other thing would be some sort of teacher? Not in travel or marketing but I do get to travel. Yeah most likely.
565efadd684776db440df94b: Nah Im an AIN and next year will be a RN. Also a cook on the weekends. How about journalism or languages?
56748527b5568d220ef5ed14: Oh cool thats pretty awesome. Which do you like better? Im not a journalist but I do have a little bit language training.
565efadd684776db440df94b: The nursing is good, I like having a positive impact on people and its very rewarding, Comercial cooking is just repetitive, learn good skills though. To be honest I have no idea what you do, 1 more guess then... theatre?
565efadd684776db440df94b: Havent forgotten about me have you? :P Hows was your day?
56748527b5568d220ef5ed14: So youre right tinder just sucks, it doesnt tell me youve replied. Thats really good Ive always liked nurses haha theyre always so nice. Theatre, ha nope no way, I did see the Sound of Music last night though and it was pretty good. My day was good I actually just saw Star Wars what about you?
565efadd684776db440df94b: Oooh I gotta see that. Not a bad night, worked but it wasnt too busy and not much icky stuff to deal with. Plenty of chocolates given to us from residents so I am now full of sugar
565efadd684776db440df94b: You still havent revealed what it is you do
56748527b5568d220ef5ed14: hear*
565efadd684776db440df94b: Audiology?
56748527b5568d220ef5ed14: Nope
565efadd684776db440df94b: Can i get a hint at least?
56748527b5568d220ef5ed14: Yeah I guess a lot of people do wear uniforms now I think about it. Its green?

56748527b5568d220ef5ed14: Yup
565efadd684776db440df94b: What a long and strange journey it has been :D to be fair you didnt make it at all obvious, at least up until just now. Well you certainly are an interesting girl then. Btw I think wevall secretly want to work at the zoo

56748527b5568d220ef5ed14: Key thing I was getting at there was girl? Thats good to know. Yeah I am Im heading overseas tomorrow.  How about you? Merry Christmas!
565efadd684776db440df94b: Ok then, woman :P where you off to? Just had lunch with mum and her parents then dinner with my dads side of the family at my aunts place. Nothing exciting at all

56748527b5568d220ef5ed14: Im just confused haha Im a guy was that a joke? Im heading to Japan, what about Nadia anyway that has a very European ring to it.
565efadd684776db440df94b: I spose it does, however the only other Nadia ive met is Indonesian. Are you really a guy? Fooled me if so, but doesnt bother me. I hope you enjoy your trip to Japan, I would love to go there one day myself
