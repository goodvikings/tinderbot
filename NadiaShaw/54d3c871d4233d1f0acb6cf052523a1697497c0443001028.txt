54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Titanic.
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Well thats my ice breaker... how you doing?
52523a1697497c0443001028: Hahaha thats the best opening message Ive got in here so far, bravo. Im doing great what about you??
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Always nice to hear Ive made a positive impression from the start. Im doing quite well thanks. Just doing some cooking ahead of the Christmas lunch with the family. Shortbread, chocolate rum balls, and fruit mince tarts. üòç
52523a1697497c0443001028: Woah! That sounds awesome. 
I just had eggs and veggies for lunch sooooooo pretty much even??

Big Christians planned in guessing?
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Eggs and veggies sounds like a pretty good lunch actually. Makes my pasta with cheese seem average. 
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Ive got "the usual" planned for Christmas. Family feast at my cousins house tomorrow night, followed by bbq at mine as a recovery session on Christmas morning. Hows your festive period shaping up?
52523a1697497c0443001028: Thats a cool Christmas, mines boring. Im working tomorrow night and Xmas night. Well have a BBQ or something next week with the family. 

My mates and I will do a pool day for the Boxing Day test though üòé
52523a1697497c0443001028: Do you have big plans for New Years too??
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Ooo, I do not envy you working tomorrow and christmas night! Where abouts do you work? 
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Actually have no plans at all for New Years. Blank canvas at the moment
52523a1697497c0443001028: The only good part is penalty rates I guess. 
Im a police officer, soon to be personal trainer too. It means working pretty much every Xmas and New Years. 
What do you do with yourself??
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Got to say, did not expect you to say you were a police officer. But that said, I have a newfound sense of respect. Im a high school teacher myself. Means Ive scored the next few weeks off on holidays which is fantastic :)
52523a1697497c0443001028: Haha whys that? What were you expecting??

High school teaching would be so rough! What subject do you do??
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: I dont know exactly what I was expecting I guess. But it is quite cool. I have a few friends who are officers around the state, so Im always in awe of their profession. 
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Ill let you guess what subjects you think I teach at school. Any ideas?
52523a1697497c0443001028: The way you write suggests English teacher, but no apostrophes so maybe not. Youre too good looking to be a science teacher. 
Although you said subjects (plural) so maybe science is your second subject. Math or history would be my guess.
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Too good looking for a science teacher is definitely one of the best compliments Ive received haha. And youre pretty much spot on with your assumptions - Im an English & History teacher. 
52523a1697497c0443001028: Haha youre welcome. How long have you been teaching for? Do you specialize in any specific history?
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Ive been working in schools for probably five or six years now. Started off working in Learning Support and ESL but then about three years ago I moved into full time teaching. 
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Im a fan of medieval and Renaissance periods of history. As dorky as it sounds, thats when all the cool stuff happened haha. But since that period isnt really taught at school, Im more of a modern history teacher than an ancient one. 
52523a1697497c0443001028: Thats mad, what other languages do you speak??
Thats not dorky, thats interesting. I studied modern history in school, mainly Germany. It was probably my favorite subject. 
Does this mean youre a fan of travel? I find most history enthusiasts travel like crazy.
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: I can speak a little Italian and some Polish. Neither very well though. How about yourself??
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: And yes, I try to go overseas each year or at the very least travel around to somewhere new whenever possible. I love learning new things about artworks or artifacts.
52523a1697497c0443001028: I wish I could speak another language, but unfortunately I cannot. However I did just do 20 countries in Europe over 7 weeks so I learnt the basics in each one sort of. Greek is ridiculous to get your head around hahah. 
Once every year is heaps! Where have you been?
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Wow! That would have been a super quick trip to go to so many countries in such a short space of time. Was it like a Contiki tour??
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Ive been through pretty much the whole of England, Scotland, Wales, and Poland. Ive also been to Belgium, Netherlands, France, Ireland, Czech Republic, Germany, Austria, Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Fiji, and America.
52523a1697497c0443001028: Yeah mine was a 7 week Contiki. It was jam packed every day but the best time of my life. There was heaps of cool sight seeing but just as much partying. 

Wow that is so much traveling. What was your favorite place?
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: If you got to go back to any place that you got to visit, where would you go back to?
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: I love being in Poland, mainly because Ive got family over there so hanging out with them is great. But I adore travelling through England. There are some amazing small towns that I stumbled across last time I was there that I want to visit again soon
52523a1697497c0443001028: I would have to say Greece. The scenery was amazing in Santorini and Athens, but the partying and relaxation in Ios was the best. There was beer pong, volleyball parasailing, pirate ships, massages, quad bikes, calm water beaches and DJs going all day. It was the beast place Ive ever been. 
I liked England, I really only saw London but it still had some cool sights. Plus I saw wicked there which was my first musical haha
Do you have plans to travel soon? Is there any place you wouldnt go back to?
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Greece is definitely on my bucket list. Ive always been mesmerised by the beaches and lifestyle of the Greek coasts. 
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Im trying to work out where to next at the moment. Im thinking maybe Vietnam or Nepal as something completely different. Or maybe Ill go to America, hire a car and drive from the west coast to the east coast. 
52523a1697497c0443001028: I cant express enough how much you need to go to Greece. Id go back there in a second if I didnt keep spending my money on things. 
Ive heard Vietnam is really good, same as Nepal. Id love to climb to the Everest base camp.
52523a1697497c0443001028: My mates and I are planning a similar thing through America next year but we want to do Bali and Thailand in April for the songkran festival too. Unfortunately work might get in the way of that though üòí
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Just looked up the Songkran Festival and it looks pretty amazing! 
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Just had a look, a trip to Nepal in May would set me back about a couple of thousand.  Hmmm... very tempting. 
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: I was thinking, would you like to go out for coffee or a drink with me sometime?
52523a1697497c0443001028: Songkran looks so good! I just want to ride an elephant down the street and soak people haha. Yeah I hear Nepal is real cheap too.
52523a1697497c0443001028: Yeah that sounds good. I have 5 days off after tomorrow night, we can organise something then. Where abouts are you from??
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Great. Sounds good. I live down in Oyster Bay. How about yourself?
52523a1697497c0443001028: I live in Miranda. Have you lived around this area your whole life??
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Ah cool. Nah, I actually lived in Bankstown until I was 20 then moved out here.
52523a1697497c0443001028: That makes sense its almost impossible to find someone around my age from here with no mutual friends haha. 
Do you work at a school around here?
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Haha yeah Ive realised that everyone knows everyone else in the shire. 
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: And no, I actually teach out in Marrickville
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: My normal rule is that I dont work within 30 mins of home. That way I dont run into students out in the "real world"
52523a1697497c0443001028: Thats a good rule, I did the same thing with my work. Im far enough away that I dont know anyone but close enough to drive.
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Merry Christmas by the way! 
52523a1697497c0443001028: Merry Christmas to you too! How was your big family thing??
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Dinner with the family was lovely last night. Always a good chance to catch up with the cousins and drink wine. How was your Christmas Eve evening? Was Santa kind to you this year?
52523a1697497c0443001028: Sounds great. Mine was full of car crashes and drunk idiots fighting haha. 
Ill find out how good Santa was in the following days. Today is just my sleeping day in between night shifts üòí
How was Santa to you this year?
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: What an awesome night shift you must have had! Filled with the joy of the Christmas spirit obviously haha. 
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Santa was quite the legend to me. New pair of Timberland boots were under the tree with my name on them! Quite chuffed with them actually! 
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: You working again today/tonight or have you got Christmas Day off?
52523a1697497c0443001028: Haha yeah the Christmas spirit was flowing last night. 
Are they for hiking and stuff? 
Nah straight back to work tonight, were having a big feast though so it should be good. Apparently it was busy at my station today though so who knows!
52523a1697497c0443001028: I hope the rest of your Christmas was great!! Ive got tomorrow and Monday night free. Shall we meet for a drink on Monday??
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Heya, sorry for the lack of conversation yesterday afternoon, had the family over so was looking after the bbq and entertaining them all. Hope what little moments of Christmas you got to experience away from work were filled with fun and joy. 
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Monday evening sounds good. Just asking, is there anything that you cant eat or drink so that I know to avoid certain things or are you pretty much okay with anything?
52523a1697497c0443001028: Thats all good. My Xmas moments were good. I ate SO MUCH FOOD! 
Nah Im good, Ill just go with whatever. Where are you thinking???
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Haha! Same. The food coma last night was out of this world. I was thinking we could go to Button Bar which is just up the road from Central. Or if youd rather, Black Sheep in Newtown is always a good place to visit.
52523a1697497c0443001028: My food coma will go until tomorrow  some time for me haha. Were on the beers pretty hard at the moment. Button bar sounds good, I work in Newtown so its probably best to stay away from there unless you want to get hassled by my work mates.
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: Haha, fair enough! Button Bar it is. How does 5.30pm on Monday sound?
54d3c871d4233d1f0acb6cf0: If things change, you can always text me - 0406 764 581
